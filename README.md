# CanDrive Smart Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
*CanDrive Smart Dashboard* is an innovative embedded system project designed as part of the PG-Diploma in Embedded System Design. This dashboard provides real-time monitoring and display of essential vehicle parameters, enhancing the safety and efficiency of vehicle operations.  

The system integrates various sensors and displays to track and present:  
- *Vehicle Speed & Distance: Calculated using an **IR sensor* to determine wheel revolutions.  
- *Device Temperature: Measured using the **TMP102 temperature sensor* and displayed on the dashboard.  
- *Door Status: Monitored using a **reed switch* to detect open or closed doors.  

## Current Status  
The project is *fully developed and operational*, but we continue to enhance its features and robustness.  

## Key Features  
1. *Real-Time Data Display*: The system provides immediate updates on all monitored parameters.  
2. *Robust Communication*:  
   - *CAN bus* for data transfer between STM32-based data collection nodes.  
   - *UART communication* to transfer sensor data from STM32 to ESP32.  
   - *MQTT protocol* over Wi-Fi for sending processed data from ESP32 to the ThingsBoard dashboard.  
3. *FreeRTOS Implementation: Used on **STM32 microcontrollers* for better control over data collection and transmission.  
4. *User-Friendly Interface*: ThingsBoard-based dashboard for visualization.

# CanDrive Smart Dash Board

## Project Overview
**CanDrive Smart Dash Board** is an innovative embedded system project designed as part of the PG-Diploma in Embedded System Design. This dashboard provides real-time monitoring and display of essential vehicle parameters, enhancing the safety and convenience of drivers. 

The system integrates various sensors and displays to track and present:
- **Vehicle Speed**: Displays the current speed of the vehicle.
- **Smoke Detection**: Alerts the driver if smoke is detected, ensuring timely intervention.
- **Engine Temperature**: Monitors and displays the temperature of the vehicle's engine.
- **Door Status**: Notifies whether any vehicle door is open or closed.

## Current Status
This project is currently in the **development phase**, with ongoing efforts focused on integrating sensors, refining data accuracy, and enhancing the user interface.

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Data Display**: Immediate updates on all monitored parameters.
2. **Safety Alerts**: Smoke detection and door-open indicators to improve safety.
3. **Multi-Sensor Integration**: Seamless communication between sensors and the display module.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-read layout tailored for drivers.
